# radixsort

Radix sort is a sorting algorithm that sorts the elements by individual digits of the same place value. Then, sort the elements.
In my radix sort implementation I have used counting sort as the place-value sorter.

Run time : Radix sort takes O(n) time to sort n integers with a fixed number of digits.
